# Gamma Engine
This game engine is written in Java and it uses OpenGL for graphics. If you are wondering, I at first thought of making this engine in C++ but I decided that Java would suffice, since the libraries do not use Java to render. For libraries, this project uses Maven to import LWJGL.

This file will be updated with further information once the project is more complete. But until then I want to thank you for taking a look around!
